## README

This is my homework when I am learning some data mining algorithms.



The algorithms include:

* Clustering(DBSCAN, DenPeak, K-Means, Spectral_clustering)

* Graph_Clustering(Kdivide,  Louvain, NMF)

* Network Embedding(KNN, LANE, M_NMF)

* Recommended System(Slope One, IBCF, MF)

  

Each file includes a dataset folder,a code folder and a pdf file explaining the algorithm and the code(written in Chinese)



you are free to ask me any question regarding this project.
